# multiDiCP

## the algorithm of multiple-group directed core-periephry algorithm, with saved test data


## Required python library

| Plugin | Website |
| ------ | ------ |
| networkX | https://networkx.org/|
| pandas | https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html |
| Numba | http://numba.pydata.org/ |
| Numpy | https://numpy.org/ |




## Run the algorithm
    - Install python 3.8
    - Install required python libraries
    - Run directed.py
The algorithm will read files in the root directory, or generate seeded scale-free network. Uncomment the part in main funtion to switch.
Please note the algorithm is not generalized for arbiturary edge indexing. It requires the node index to be consecutive integers from 0 to N-1 where N is the number of edge.

## Perform extra runs
    -Run post_process.py
4 layers of extra runs are implemented, excessive runs will save empty result

## Content of files
|File | Content |
| ------ | ------ |
| DATAEXTRACT.gml | Network generated by networkX, saved in .gml format for importing use |
| DATAEXTRACT.xlsx | The extracted edge list from the complete dataset file, also some faulty index are fixed. |
| dexten.xlsx| 1/10 fraction of the dataset, a list with 10000 edges |
The edge list only include indices.
