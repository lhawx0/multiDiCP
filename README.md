# multiDiCP

## the algorithm of multiple-group directed core-periephry algorithm, with saved test data


## Required python library

| Plugin | Website |
| ------ | ------ |
| networkX | https://networkx.org/|
| pandas | https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html |
| Numba | http://numba.pydata.org/ |
| Numpy | https://numpy.org/ |




## Run the algorithm
    - Install python 3.8
    - Install required python libraries
    - Run directed.py
The algorithm will read files in the root directory, or generate seeded scale-free network. Uncomment the part in main funtion to switch.
    
## Perform extra runs
    -Run post_process.py
4 layers of extra runs are implemented, excessive runs will save empty result

## Content of files
|File | Content |
